I am a technology enthusiast. I have deep knowledge in Java development and I also have some experience with Javascript, Python and Go. I am also a speaker and a software architect at Red Hat. I have over 17 years of experience in IT projects and a long history of experience in design, optimization and implementation of service oriented architectures, microservices, and application modernization. In so many projects, I have contributed with best practices, solutions, and documentation in the following topics: Quarkus, Wildfly, 3scale, Apache Camel, Messaging with Strimzi, Kafka, OKD, and kubernetes. More onver, I also enjoy playing with videogames, home automation, reading books, listen to rock and metal music and writing.
